To add a custom structure to the game (e.g., to spawn in villages/plains):

1. Create or obtain a structure file (.mcstructure).
2. Name it "mysterious_statue.mcstructure" (or update the "structure_name" in addon_bp/features/village_structure_feature.json).
3. Place the file in this folder (addon_bp/structures/).
4. The structure is configured to spawn in Plains biomes (addon_bp/feature_rules/village_structure_rule.json).
